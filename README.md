# alfred-workflow-objectid

This Alfred Workflow plugin can parse MongoDB ObjectId objects, and extract information from it, e.g. timestamp, machine hash, etc. 

Attention: at present, only generation-time extraction is supported. Other ObjectId components will be supported in forthcoming releases.
